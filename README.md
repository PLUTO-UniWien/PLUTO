# PLUTO

> Public Value Assessment Tool

The risks and harms of digital data do not lie in the data itself; they come from how the data is used. PLUTO is a tool for assessing the benefits and risks of specific instances of data use. The weighing of risks and benefits results in a score that indicates the public value of data use.

PLUTO can be used by anyone wanting to know how much public value the use of data for a specific purpose generates: By companies, organisations, public bodies, or citizens. It asks questions in four categories:

- Information about the data user
- Benefits of the data use
- Risks of the data use
- Institutional safeguards

You do not need to have access to proprietary or any other highly specialised information to use this tool - but it is helpful to know the basic conditions under which data is used, and by whom. In a nutshell, the more a specific instance of data use benefits people and communities without putting individuals or groups at risk, the higher the public value.

This repository is the embodiment of the PLUTO tool.
