      "introduction": "## Introduction\n\nThis appendix accompanies [PLUTO](https://pluto.univie.ac.at/), a structured assessment tool which assesses the public value of data use. The tool consists of a questionnaire, in which each answer has been assigned a specific weight which contributes to the userâ€™s public value score. In this document, we outline the weighting behind each answer as well as our reasoning for setting the weights as such.\n\nAnswers which are scored along the y axis represent foreseeable benefits of data use. A higher y score will contribute to a higher public value score. Answers which are scored along the x axis represent risk. A higher x score represents reduced risk, and therefore increases the public value score.\n\nWe as the developers of this tool are conscious that any attempt to provide a score pertaining to a complex concept such as public value comes with trade-offs. We have decided the below weighting scheme on the basis of international precedents, our own research (click here for a reading list) and considerations which arose over the course of the project. For the sake of transparency, we are making our approach to this assessment clear.\n\nIf you have any comments on how the weightings could be improved, [we would love to hear from you](mailto:seliem.el-sayed@univie.ac.at).\n\nFinally, please note that the weights listed are subject to adjustment.
