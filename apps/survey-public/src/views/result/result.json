      "explanation": "### About Public Value\n\nThe conception of public value underpinning this tool focuses on the sustainability of benefits, the extent to which\nthese benefits address future societal needs, the distribution of benefits, the nature and severity of (conceivable)\nharm, the stability of safeguards, that is routine risk assessment prior to and during the deployment of the data use,\nand the possibility of correcting occurred harm swiftly and effectively. The public value is a weighted composite of\nrisks and benefits of the data use.\n\n#### High Public Value\n\nIf benefits are high and risks are low, this means that the data use that you inquired about creates high public value.\nIt is likely to benefit people or communities without putting anyone at great risk. This means that the data use can (\nand often: should) go ahead. In some cases it means that it is so valuable that\nit [should ideally receive public support](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00189-3/fulltext) \\-\ne.g. in terms of funding, or by qualifying for regulatory exemptions. We cannot grant such support ourselves, but we\nhope that the high public value score can help you access it - if not now, then in the future, when public value\nreceives more systematic consideration in legislation and regulation.\n\n#### Medium Public Value\n\nIf benefits are high, but so are risks, this means that the data use that you inquired about creates some public value.\nIt is likely to benefit people and communities but also puts some people at risk. In this case, the data use should only\ngo ahead if the risks can be reduced to an acceptable level.\n\n#### Low Public Value\n\nIf benefits are low, and so are risks, the data use in question creates low public value. Nevertheless, because the\nassociated risks are low, it may go ahead if rules and practices are in place that ensure that some of the commercial\nprofits obtained with the data come back to people and communities. You can\nfind [more information on benefit sharing here.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00189-3/fulltext)\n\n#### No Public Value\n\nIf benefits are low and risks are high, the data use in question creates no public value. Such data use should not go\nahead.",
