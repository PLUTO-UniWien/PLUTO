An indirect financial risk would be individuals denied insurance or loan applications on the basis of predictions made via the data use. \n\nInformational Risk: Informational risk is the potential for harm from disclosure of information about an identified individual. All sensitive personal data falls under this category, as well as anonymised data which can be conceivably re-identified. \n\nLegal Risk: This could include infringing upon the legal rights of data subjects, such as their right to privacy. Data uses which inadvertently generate discrimination may also risk legal consequences. \n\nSocial Risk: If the data use risks the social well-being of individuals or communities, and/or includes sensitive social descriptors, such as sexual orientation. \n\nPolitical Risk: Data that includes sensitive political indicators (e.g., voting preference, party affiliation, union membership) carries a political risk if they are mishandled or misused.

The German Constitution (Basic Law) for instance prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, origin, ethnicity, language, belief, religious and political views, and disability (Article 3 Basic Law). Adverse effects on groups who are afforded special protection under the law may also be generated incidentally and unintended (such as a loan application being denied).  This question should be answered in line with those groups protected in the relevant jurisdiction or, if inapplicable, in international Human Rights law.  \n\nThis question aims to assess the foreseeable risk of an instance of data use for such groups.
